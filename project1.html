        Environmental Impact
      </h2>
      <p>
        Urban green spaces serve as natural air purifiers, filtering out
        pollutants and improving air quality for city residents. They play a
        crucial role in mitigating the urban heat island effect by cooling down
        surrounding areas, reducing the need for air conditioning, and lowering
        energy consumption. These green areas not only provide environmental
        benefits but also enhance the well-being of communities by offering
        recreational spaces and boosting mental health. By integrating nature
        into urban environments, cities become more resilient to climate change
        and more sustainable for future generations.

        Public Health Benefits
      </h2>
      <p>
        Access to green spaces plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall well-being of urban populations through several key mechanisms:
        <ul>
            <li>Encourages Physical Activity: Green spaces provide an inviting environment for outdoor activities like walking, jogging, cycling, and sports. This access motivates urban residents to engage in regular physical exercise, promoting better cardiovascular health, weight management, and reducing the risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and obesity.</li>
            <li>Improves Mental Health: Exposure to nature and green environments has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The tranquility and aesthetic appeal of parks and gardens provide a peaceful escape from urban life's fast pace, fostering relaxation and mental rejuvenation.</li>
            <li>Enhances Social Connections: Public green spaces create opportunities for social interactions, fostering a sense of community. Whether through group activities, social gatherings, or simply shared use of the space, these areas help combat social isolation and strengthen communal bonds.</li>
            <li>Environmental Benefits: Green spaces contribute to cleaner air, reduce urban heat island effects, and support biodiversity. These environmental improvements not only directly benefit public health but also make urban areas more resilient to climate-related stressors, contributing to long-term sustainability.</li>
        </ul>

          <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Residents living within 300 meters of
          green space were 26% more likely to meet recommended physical activity
          levels.

        Social and Economic Impacts
      </h2>
      <p>
        Urban green spaces foster a sense of community by offering shared areas where residents can gather, socialize, and build connections, strengthening neighborhood ties. These spaces not only enhance the quality of life but also positively impact property values, as homes near parks and green areas tend to be more desirable. This leads to increased investment in local neighborhoods, making them more vibrant, attractive, and economically valuable. Additionally, green spaces can promote environmental sustainability, further enhancing a neighborhood’s long-term appeal and resilience.

        Recommendations for Sustainable Urban Planning
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourage green roofs and vertical gardens in dense urban areas</li>
        <li>Develop public-private partnerships for green space maintenance</li>
        <li>Prioritize green space development in underserved neighborhoods</li>
        <li>Design climate-resilient green spaces with native plants</li>
